        <h3>Why Should We Be Conscious?</h3>
        <p>The entertainment industry is saturated with content to the extent that we may not always be conscious of how much we consume. The cinematic industry within that is huge, and with big budget films and franchises, continues to grow. With the rise of streaming they are now within reach of an even larger audience: an audience that desires representation within those stories. Women and racial minorities are historically underrepresented in movies, and when they are included, are often relegated to supporting characters, love interests and stereotypical roles. As we raise awareness on female topics in our contemporary society, we must also examine the images of females that we digest. Movies are a huge part of that. If the only characters that society is watching women play are those who play second fiddle to their male co-stars, a subtle bias is being built. Having female voices that young women can grow up watching, and relating to, is important.</p>
        <p>This issue has been brought to center stage in the past few years. A call for more representation and equality for women in front of and behind the scenes of the filmmaking process has seen slow, but tangible, results. </p>

        <h4>What is the Blechdel Test?</h4>
        <p>The Bechdel Test, sometimes called the Mo Movie Measure or Bechdel Rule is a simple test which names the following three criteria:</p>
          <p>(1) it has to have at least two named female characters in it, who </p>
          <p>(2) who talk to each other, about</p>
          <p>(3) something besides a man. </p>
        <p>The test was popularized by Alison Bechdel's comic Dykes to Watch Out For, in a 1985 strip called The Rule.</p>

        <h4>Pros and Cons</h4>
        <p>The Blechdel Test is not perfect, although it is noteable that manny contemporary films still do not pass it. The Blechdel test should, in the future, serve as the bare minimum requirement for a movie script that recognizes the value of it's female characters. It does not take into account diversity, content, or female representation in the crew of a movie, which are additional facets that we must hold producers accountable for.</p>

        <h4>Alternatives</h4>
        <p>The Blechdel Test has been around for a while and as a result, is one of the most known measures for female film representation. However, the gap that it leaves has not been overlooked by critics and movie enthusiasts! Tests such as the 'Mako Mori', 'Ellen Willis', 'Racial Blechdel', 'Duvernay' and others have been proposed to highlighy gender roles, strong female characters and diverse casting.

        <p>This scatterplot compares the budget's of a film (shown on the x axis) to the domestic gross of the movie (shown on the y axis) minus the budget. Movies that passed are shown in burgundy.</p>
        <p>Indie and artistic films are often likely to pass the Blechdel test however, larger budget films have more trouble. There is a noticeably higher distribution of non-Blechdel passing films near the end of the chart indicating higher budgets. Of those movies, a larger percentage of them are breaking even in comparison to their budget.</p>
